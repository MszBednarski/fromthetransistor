#### Section 1: Intro: Cheating our way past the transistor -- 0.5 weeks
- So about those transistors -- Course overview. Describe how FPGAs are buildable using transistors, and that ICs are just collections of transistors in a nice reliable package. Understand the LUTs and stuff. Talk briefly about the theory of transistors, but all projects must build on each other so we canâ€™t build one.
- Emulation -- Building on real hardware limits the reach of this course. Using something like Verilator will allow anyone with a computer to play.

##### NPN transistor:
transistor is basically as switch which can have an on or off state.
so a transistor has 3 pins a base collector and emmiter
if you apply volatage <0.7V to the base the transistor is in an OFF state
and current doesnt flow from the collector to the emmiter
if you apply voltage >0.7v to the base the transistor is in an ON state and
current flows from the collector to the emiiter

ICs are integrated circuts
they are prepacked electronic circuts for reuse
